This repository contains a Python-based automation system for collecting, processing, and organizing financial data on US-listed stocks, particularly those included in the S&P 500 index (SPY).

### üìÅ Repository Contents

1. **Ticker.csv**  
   A base file containing a list of ticker symbols used as input for data extraction.

2. **Actual_Stock.py**  
   A Python script that:
   - Reads the tickers from `Ticker.csv`.
   - Downloads the latest **Close Price** for each ticker.
   - Retrieves key financial indicators including:
     - Market Capitalization (`marketCap`)
     - Price-to-Earnings Ratios (`trailingPE`, `forwardPE`)
     - Volatility (`beta`)
     - Earnings per Share (`trailingEps`)
     - Industry (`industry`)
     - Sector (sector)
     - Number of Full-Time Employees (`fullTimeEmployees`)
     - Country (`country`)
